## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

- **Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 
-  **Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

I really enjoyed this project. I have learned how to integrate multiple APIs effectively (Google Maps and Rapid API). I also became more confident in my ability to use Plotly and other visualization tools. It was one of the last features I added to my project, but it was super easy to implement and customize. I also learned and practiced how to make Pytests for my code, which was very helpful. 

One of the biggest challenges I faced was how to handle user errors. Initially, my program would crash if users entered incomplete or incorrect data. I fixed this by using checks and clear error messages. I also struggled with the limted ability to customize with streamlit. I tried to change the font and background color of the streamlit but was unable to locate the config.toml file. This will definitely be my next task

 If I had more time, I would add an in-depth explanation to all the signs and placements, as well as a more interactive visual. I found an API that creates a visual mapping of your birth chart, which I thought was very interesting but too complicated for this project.
 
 Overall, I really enjoyed this project and this class.
