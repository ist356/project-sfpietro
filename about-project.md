### What it does
This is an astrology app. You enter in your birth date and get back your full birth chart including your "big three": sun, moon and rising sign. It will then provide two graphs to showcase the data. one is a scatter plot that shows which sign each planet is in. The other is a pie chart showing what % you are of each sign. You then have the option to recive a daily horoscope as well as a quick explantion for each placement.

### Other things you need to know
